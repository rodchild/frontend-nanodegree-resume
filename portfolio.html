                        <p>Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the Critical Rendering Path course.</p>

                        <p>Developing of a single-page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. Adding additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party Wikipedia APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations.</p>

                        <p>Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty. Write a new test suite named "The menu". Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous so this test wil require the use of Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done()function. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous. When complete - all of your tests should pass.</p>
